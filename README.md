# Destruction and Creation

This is [John Boyd's][1] 1976 inquiry into the nature of creativity. It is
freely [available as a PDF][2], which is useful for printing but not for
reading or manipulating. It is included as an appendix in Robert Coram's [Boyd
biography][3], which is available in digital format, but is poorly formatted.

I have converted the article into Markdown-flavored plain text, with a BibTeX
bibliography, suitable for processing via [Pandoc][4].
